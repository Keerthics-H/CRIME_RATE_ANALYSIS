# CRIME_RATE_ANALYSIS

Problem Statement:
The large volumes of crime data-sets as well as the complexity of relationships between these kinds of data have made 
criminology an appropriate field for applying data mining techniques. Criminology is an area that focuses the scientific 
study of crime and criminal behaviour and law enforcement and is a process that aims to identify crime characteristics.
It is one of the most important fields where the application of data mining techniques can produce important results. 
Identifying crime characteristics is the first step for developing further analysis. The knowledge gained from data mining 
approaches is a very useful tool which can help and support police forces. Clustering techniques converts data-sets to 
clusters which are further examined for determining crime prone areas. These clusters visually represent the group of 
crimes overlaid on map of police jurisdiction.

Proposed Solution:
Initially, the data set is prepared manually. After identifying the relationships and visualizing the data, we create a 
regression model for forecasting the percapita. For this model, we have used Multi Linear regression model. Other models 
such as the Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models were also tested, but the Multi Linear Regression produced 
the minimal error while training the model. This regression model predicts the percapita of Crime rate that is going to be 
happen in future by taking different parameters.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
Hard disk : 500 GB
RAM : 2 GB 
Processor : Pentium i3

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
Operating System : Windows 10
Coding Language : Python

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
From the encouraging results, we believe that crime data mining has a promising future for increasing the effectiveness 
and efficiency of criminal and intelligence analysis. Visual and intuitive criminal and intelligence investigation techniques
can be developed for crime pattern. As we have applied clustering technique of data mining for crime analysis we can 
also perform other techniques of data mining such as classification. Also we can perform analysis on various datase.

CONCLUSION:
The sparsity of crime in many areas complicates the application of the prediction rate area-specific modelling. We used 
the Machine Learning algorithm in that work to create and test age, sex, year, month prediction of crime. In that job we 
use three types of machine learning algorithms : Linear regression, Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours among which 
we discover distinct precision in different instances, some linear operates good and provides better precision but the 
general situation K-Nearest Neighbour provides the appreciated accuracy other than that’s why we use K-Nearest 
Neighbours for our Crime Prediction scheme. By using these predict systems we will discover the stronger precision in 
the future and also by using this precision we will discover the stronger precision in the future and also by using this 
precision we will identify and discover the hot zone region in crime rate. In order to finish this job, we would like to use 
the CNN algorithm to analyze picture information and add the Google API for viewing the hot zone.
